# Topic-DiscordLogs

Good day, I have finished something small here.

I know there are already several Discord log scripts. Nevertheless, I present you my free DiscordLog script.

What do I offer?
- Support for questions
- Change requests / ideas are welcome
- bug fixes
- Will be updated
- Log for: Commands | Items | Weapons | Money | Drugs | Resources | Ambulance | Society
- Create your own log events.

If you want to use the logs: Commands, Items, Weapons, Money you have to make changes in es_extended.
See [es_extended/README.md](https://github.com/TopicElite/Topic-DiscordLogs/tree/main/es_extended).

If you want to use the DrugsLog, I offer a template for esx_drugs, otherwise you can find all events in [esx_drugs/README.md](https://github.com/TopicElite/Topic-DiscordLogs/tree/main/esx_drugs).

If you want to use the AmbulanceLog, I offer a template for [esx_ambulancejob](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy/tree/main/%5Besx_addons%5D/esx_ambulancejob).

If you want to use the SocietyLog, I offer a template for [esx_society](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy/tree/main/%5Besx_addons%5D/esx_society).

For further questions I am available on my Discord server. 

Bugs or requests are welcome to be reported via my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TymDT77Fvd)
